Case 1:
	With stack protection and non-executable stack flags turned on the shellcode does not execute.
Case 2:
	-fno-stack-protecter turns off the stack protector. But since the stack is not executable it goes into segmentation fault.
Case 3:
	With both stack protection and executable stack turned off the shell opens.
